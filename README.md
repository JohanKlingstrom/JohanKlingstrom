# Hey, I'm Johan.

I'm a frontend dev (student) from Stockholm. I'm also many other things, like an electronic musician, video game nerd, ramen enthusiast and friend of cats.

## What am I doing right now?
ðŸš€ Interning at North Kingdom!

ðŸ“š Learning how to build stuff with TypeScript, Next.js, Three.js and Unreal Engine 5.
