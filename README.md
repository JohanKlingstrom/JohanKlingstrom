# Hey, I'm Johan.

I'm a frontend dev intern from Stockholm! I'm also many other things, like an electronic musician, video game nerd, ramen enthusiast and friend of cats.

## What am I doing right now?
ðŸš€ Currently exploring the north of Sweden through a new office.

ðŸ“š Trying to learn to work with 3D in the web, right now through messing around with Three.js.
