# Hey, I'm Johan.

I'm a frontend dev intern from Stockholm! I'm also many other things, like an electronic musician, video game nerd, ramen enthusiast and friend of cats.

## What am I doing right now?
ðŸš€ Interning at North Kingdom in northern Sweden.

ðŸ“š Learning how to build web apps with TypeScript, frontend in Next.js, and cool stuff in Unreal Engine 5.
