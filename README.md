I'm a frontend dev intern from Stockholm! I'm also many other things, like an electronic musician, video game nerd, ramen enthusiast and friend of cats.

## What am I doing right now?
ðŸš€ Currently exploring the north of Sweden through a new office.

ðŸ“š I'm trying to learn to work with 3D in the web, right now through messing around with Three.js. I've most recently applied it on my portfolio homepage which you can check out [here](https://johanklingstrom.netlify.app).
