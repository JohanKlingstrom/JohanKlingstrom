# Hey! I'm Johan 🌌

I'm a frontend dev student at Hyper Island in Stockholm! I'm also many other things, like an electronic musician and DJ, video game nerd, ramen enthusiast and friend of cats. 

## Some quick fun little notes about me;
- Four years of professional experience editing esports data 🕹️
- Over two million streams on Spotify 🎵
- Studied philosophy at Stockholms University 💭

## What am I doing right now? 🤔

🚀 Currently I'm on a journey of trying to find my place in the world of programming. Logic and exploring patterns has always been fun to me, growing up in love with video games and electronic music. Getting into code the past year with that perspective has been fun so far, and I'm excited to learn how to make more cool stuff!

📚 I'm trying to learn to work with 3D in the web, right now through messing around with Three.js! I've most recently applied it on my portfolio homepage which you can check out here!

🔭 Some of the tech I've been using the last year includes HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Express, Node, MongoDB, Sanity, Three.js, Next and Tailwind. I've heard cool things about Svelte, so I'd like to explore that in the future as well.
